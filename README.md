# FuturixTools

FuturixTools is a set of minor utilities I wrote to simplify some of the tasks many Windows users do. It includes tools that do the following:

* Empty Recycle Bin
* Clear system list of recent used documents
* Refresh file format associations
* Launch screensaver
* Turn off system display

All of them were written in Windows XP era, but might work reasonably well in newer versions of Windows too.

Tools:  
Delphi
